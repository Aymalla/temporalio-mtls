# Encryption in transit with mTLS

Temporal supports Mutual Transport Layer Security (mTLS) as a way of encrypting network traffic
between the services of a cluster and also between application processes and a Cluster.
Self-signed or properly minted certificates can be used for mTLS. mTLS is set in
Temporal's [TLS configuration](https://docs.temporal.io/references/configuration/#tls).
The configuration includes two sections such that intra-Cluster and external traffic can be
encrypted with different sets of certificates and settings:

- `internode:` Configuration for encrypting communication between nodes in the cluster.
- `frontend:` Configuration for encrypting the Frontend's public endpoints.
A customized configuration can be passed using either the
[WithConfig](https://docs.temporal.io/references/server-options#withconfig) or
[WithConfigLoader](https://docs.temporal.io/references/server-options#withconfig) Server options.

## Prerequisites

- Java JDK 17+
- Docker
- Azure CLI
- openssl
- jq

`**Note:** In case the dev-container is used, all dependencies are already installed.`

## Get Started

- Clone repository `git clone https://github.com/Aymalla/temporalio-mtls.git`.
- An Azure Key Vault need to be created to store certificates.
The caller also needs `Key Vault Certificates Officer` and `Key Vault Secrets User` RBAC roles
to create, import certificates and download private keys.
- Login to your subscription `az login`
- Generate certificates for mTLS using Azure Key Vault `make keyvault-certs kv=<Key Vault Name>`.
- Start temporal cluster `make start-temporal-cluster-mtls`.
- Start workflow worker `make start-worker`.
- Trigger new helloworld workflow instance `http://localhost:8000/workflow/start`.
- Access Temporal dashboard UI to check running history
`http://localhost:8080/namespaces/default/workflows`.

## Make file

A Makefile provides a front-end to interact with the project. It is used both locally, during CI,
and on GitHub Actions. This Makefile is self-documented, and has the following targets:

```text
